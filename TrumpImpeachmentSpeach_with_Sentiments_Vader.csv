"He warned us repeatedly against NATO countries’ funding of Putin’s war Machine. The Leftists mocked him, called him a Nazi (has  he murdered his Jewish daughter yet???). His meeting with the NATO Sec-Gen in 2018 is pretty interesting, was very very direct and clear that dependence on Russia’s fossil fuels was extremely dangerous. But he was thought a pal of Putin because of his NYC commercial real estate  negotiating  style of “butter-them-up in public to appeal to their vanity, then kick them in the balls behind closed doors.”  …then tell them to straighten their tie and smile  . —“Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.”

"Irans ruling family is doing what China had been doing surreptitiously to the people since the Warring Periods from 1600 BC and before. it wasn’t obvious with China because it’s soo large and devious. The Han majority is the Native Chinese that they took control over being a minority tribe, a  conquest Clan using different name Dynasty puppet kings emperors, the Han had only 400 years “free” in those time.. they failed because the people failed to back themselves.. to allowed the easy takeover.. I’d say the Manchus were corrupt and mixed Middle Eastern Aisin Gioro and the corrupt eunuchs toward the late 18th—19th century gave rise to the CCP; the rest of the whole Chinese in the past 3620 yearshad been under one system of Authoritarian rule, run by 1 or 2 families Clan that secretly were behind the scenes; the CCP is only a continuation of that one minority Clansmen running the Country so that they exempt themselves from policies they passed, like “1 child policy” only apply to Han people, doesn’t apply to them being because they’re not true “Chinese” but a minority mixed group that’s a conquest dynasty clan.. No one sees this evil because those who spoke up got killed and it has changed names as different dynasties names so no one questioned but those are mere figureheads.. the same authoritarian legalism strict corrupt rulership stands in the shadows. USA too had Congress as the permanent faces that’s behind the POTUS who they can switch out every 4 year and had max 8 years so nothing can be done to challenge or change.
One woman challenged the rule.. managed only 15 years and soon died: Wu Zetian had to play their rules for awhile whilst doing secretly help give power back to the people. They tried to rid of her but then you can’t erase the truth in the hearts of people and in the people families farmers she had helped, so in time the truth comes out regardless, for later generations despite their efforts in censorship etc. Evil, Darkness must recede if we’re to live in the Light.. transparency.",-0.9837

"Anyone willing to fight the deep state system has my vote.
when will people realize we are run, not by the politicians, but the NGOs, secret services, interest groups, conglomerates we know nothing about? How convenient for you to have power, but no one knows anything about you. Anything is possible and allowed, from that position. 
if it's NGOs that should run the world and decide according to leftists, then let the people vote NGOs and not people. But the NGOs would need to address two matters: where they get their money from & how they use the money. 
Oh, forgot that NGOs are hiding their sources. And no, I'm not talking about ""america"", I'm talking about ANY country. 
Folks, you see the politician, you get the chance to vote, you can see his/her accomplishments and vote again or not. The politician can be opposed or not, the man can be hated or not, impeached or not, but are we really not paying attention to what happens backstage? 
NGOs are running business along with interest groups and the secret services and it got so out of hand that we cannot put them back in their place at this moment in time. They are an invisible disease. 

Whoever came up with this NGO idea, either was a brilliant manipulative mind or did not intend to do this at all and things got out of hand. But NGOs are the new religious group from the middle ages that tells you to ""believe and do not doubt"". You are either with them no matter what or if you dare to question their activity and purposes even in the slightest you are burned on the rug, shamed. Repeating mistakes just because it's presented in a different form to us? 


Europe is on a wrong path due to politics made by and for NGOs and very rarely for the people. Look at Macron the puppet, look at Merkel the dictator, running the EU on guidelines from Soros. Soros who has weekly meetings with all the EU leaders. His NGOs are paying ""courses and training"" for politicians, or create them in a lab and then give them a seat.",-0.3816

The delivery is largely an incoherent twisted tapestry of truth, lacks any passion and it looks like every turn-of-head-and-body is a scripted event to address each side of the hall. Boring. Self-aggrandizement. Whitewash of America's global terror, and his abuse of law, order, diplomacy and international law with a faux moral component that's a cover for his actual lawbreaking and violation of treaties that bring ill-repute to the nation he professes to govern. A soft blanket of lies and perversions of truth in the tone of someone struggling to present himself as an occupant of the moral high ground, while standing in a morass of corruption. 

Just a big whitewash of all his gross mismanagement on the global stage, and his abuses of human rights. No wonder he can't add any conviction to these words that dribble from his mouth without meaning.",-0.9545

This is the very essence of Socialism in that we emerged from a tyranical monarchies and severe police states that permitted military injustices to occupy homes without consent of its owners. This man doesn't know and never wanted to know our history and is a 5 time draft dodger. His multiple violations of our constitutional tenets makes him a criminal. He speaks of other nations needing to pay their debts which is rich coming from the child a man who used him to hide his wealth and avoid paying his taxes along with his sister and he too used similar schemes to avoid paying his taxes. His refusal to provide his tax returns is another violation of his many broken promises and he is unworthy to represent our nation or her interests. He is unfit to be an American citizen  and even more unfit to be her president. He talks of China not following the rule of law yet he swore an oath to uphold our Constitution and our laws as a requirement of the presidency but in his tenure he has violated more laws than he has upheld. Impeach this so-called president.

"King James Bible Matthew 24:15

"Trump is close but I wish I could fill him in on a few things! One: democracy equals NWO, our founding fathers hated democracy! In a democracy 51 percent rule the other 49 percent or 70 percent rule 30 percent it's majority rules! We are a constitutional republic which is the basis in which our founding fathers founded this country on! We all have the same rights as individuals not as a majority! 
Two: property rights, in America they say we have the right to own property but we have to pay the government every year to own the property so we never really own it, if we don't pay the taxes then they will put a tax lien on it and auction it off! I can see paying a sales tax on it cause a sales tax is optional, if you don't want to pay the sales tax you don't have to buy the property! I don't even mind paying taxes on it until it's paid for but once the property is paid off taxes should stop! Also a lot of our rights have been taken and sold back to us as privileges! Car registration, once you pay to register the vehicle that should be the end of it! It's bad enough that we have to register our private property with the state cause we shouldn't have too but I can live with registering it and paying for it one time but they take it upon themselves to expire the registration every year so we have to pay very year to use what is rightfully ours, if we don't pay it they will confiscate it and if you try and stop them from taking your property they will kidnap you and throw you in a cage and even go as far as killing you for resisting! There are a few other things too but in all honesty we pay for permission to what they call property rights and we pay every year for it! That's wrong, it's extortion, taxation is theft! The only tax I'm okay with is a sales tax cause like I said it's optional, don't want to pay a sales tax then we don't have to buy what they are taxing! Now Trump gave it to them good about globalist and the second amendment even though the second amendment has been infringed upon! They need to back off the infringement! I would like to talk to Trump and explain a few things that need to change! Once someone pays off a home they are using as a residence the  that shouldn't be taxed because that is people's safety net, a roof over there head and assures them they won't ever be homeless which is a huge problem in this country right now! Oh I really need to talk to him cause my county is involved in stealing property if they don't pay excessive fines which our constitution says no cruel or unusual punishment or excessive fines! If you read this Mr President or someone in your administration reads it's please call me at 530 250 7779!",-0.9846

I learned more today than what I've been hearing on the news and internet these past three years. He covered so many important issues even technology clearing up misconceptions on tons of subjects put out by the media and internet and by Trump haters.

"The Chinese have been ripping off everyone, in particular America the most and for too long. You go to any store, there is a 90%+ rate of non-consumable goods made in China. The Baby Boomers have betrayed America, they have deprived their children a source of income in favor of cheap goods from China. To suggest what President Trump is asking for is too much is dangerously naive and proven unsustainable. China has become the world's largest exporter and their influence too strong in the last 40 years. What President Trump is doing should have been done by our career Washington insiders but they are part of the globalist agenda to destabilize America from within, as treasonous agents they have found safe haven in the Democrats political party and use the mainstream media to force their singular narrative that what President Trump is doing is wrong, when in fact, it is the best thing to have happen to the United States in modern history. For the first time in living memory, President Trump is doing what needs to be done to bring America out of the hole the globalist puppets the Democrats like the Clintons, Biden, and Obama have dug. He is exposing their Deep State system as the frauds they are for infecting government and corrupting the offices they held. This is why they are fighting so hard to get him out, and to continue the status quo of selling out to China for another 40 years!",-0.3801

"Tedious. What a complete fool. However, he does seem to have learned to read, at least the words somebody wrote for him. It's laughable, in a horrendous way, and obvious when he has no idea what he's even talking about.  PUPPET. LIAR. INFANT. Just some of the words that come to mind to capture his core being. I really hope people can see through his disguise. America has always been ""great"" and his legions of minions GRATE on my very last nerve. I have had it and just going to retreat into my own little world and hope I die before the coming war in the great old DIVIDED and ALTERED STATES OF AMERICAN'T that sadly  seems so inevitable at this time. Good luck to humanity. At this point, we are completely screwed.",-0.8919
"That's the worst most ignorant, misinformed lie filled garbage to spew from a mouth in my life. No on in that room respects him or the US because everything he says is straight spin. He has hurt American economy greatly. dont believe me? When the economy continues to crash over the next 4 years as it already has this year, taxes will keep going up and billionaires will keep putting our money into their pockets because repulcinas let them. Thanks guys. Hopefully god can forgive you.",-0.688
